    <Line>k__BackingField: Timothy demoted me after Steve spoke up against him.
  - <Name>k__BackingField: Jordy
    <Line>k__BackingField: They put Steve away for good and demoted me. Since Steve
      and I were both your loyal personal guards, he also didn't trust me anymore.
  - <Name>k__BackingField: Jordy
    <Line>k__BackingField: However, he could not just put me in jail, as that would
      clearly be tyranny.
  - <Name>k__BackingField: Jordy
    <Line>k__BackingField: Bad choice on his side I suppose, because I am still loyal
      to you.
  <Response>k__BackingField:
  - <Text>k__BackingField: So what now?
