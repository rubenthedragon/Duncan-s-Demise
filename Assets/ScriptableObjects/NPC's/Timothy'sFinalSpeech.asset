  - <Name>k__BackingField: Timothy
    <Line>k__BackingField: Duncan de Molay, once a proud defender of our kingdom,
      prince and my brother. Our citizens looked up to you, our armies respected
      you and I loved you.
  - <Name>k__BackingField: Timothy
    <Line>k__BackingField: Now, you are known by many other names... Murderer, traitor,
      bringer of doom, liberator of monstrosities.
  - <Name>k__BackingField: Timothy
    <Line>k__BackingField: Our father saw the corruption in you long before me. It
      is only thanks to him that I got the throne and not you. If it wasn't for him,
      who knows what you would've done to our beautiful kingdom.
  - <Name>k__BackingField: Timothy
    <Line>k__BackingField: Our father had warned me about you, but I did not want
      to believe it, so I gave you another chance. I wanted to be able to trust my
      own brother. My worst mistake as king.
  - <Name>k__BackingField: Timothy
    <Line>k__BackingField: 'You have shown time and time again that you can''t be
      trusted. First you leave the kingdom while we needed you the most, when our
      father died as a hero in battle. Not long after, you free the most dangerous
      monster on the planet: the Entity, trying to kill us all.'
  - <Name>k__BackingField: Timothy
    <Line>k__BackingField: It is because of this we will end you here and now, so
      you can bring no more harm to our people.
  - <Name>k__BackingField: Timothy
    <Line>k__BackingField: May you suffer for eternity...
  <Response>k__BackingField: []
